                <h1>The Vaccinator</h1>
                <h3>This game was made in 36 hours for a high school hackathon with the 
                    theme being COVID where it won Best Overall Project.
                    <br><br>
                    Unlike all my other games, this was developed in a team of three people where I worked on the programming,
                    another worked on the art, and another worked on a required presentation for the hackathon.
                    <br><br>
                    This was my first hackathon and I was extremely pleased with the experience, and I look forward to working
                    in more team environments like that in the future.
