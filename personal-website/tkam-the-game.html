                <h1>To Kill A Mockingbird: The Game</h1>
                <h3>This game was made for my 9th grade English teacher.<br><br> I made a game for one of my school projects ealier that year,
                     and he said he had always wanted one of his students to make a game version of To Kill A Mockingbird.
                    <br><br>
                    It was an awesome feeling to hear him call it "legendary" and he remains one of my favorite teachers that I've ever had.
